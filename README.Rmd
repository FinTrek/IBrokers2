### Overview

The package *IBrokers2* is derived from, and is a superset of the package *IBrokers*. This means that all the *IBrokers* functions and variables are preserved exactly in *IBrokers2*, while some additional functions have been added.  The new functions mostly provide additional trade execution capabilities, for running systematic trading strategies in a callback loop.

More information can be found in the document *real_time_trading.html* in the vignettes sub-directory.


### Installation and Loading

Install package *IBrokers2* from github:  
```{r eval=FALSE}
if (!("package:devtools" %in% search() || require("devtools", quietly=TRUE)))
    install.packages("devtools")

library(IBrokers2)
```
