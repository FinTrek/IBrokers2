### Overview

The package *IBrokers2* is derived from, and is a superset of the package *IBrokers*. This means that all the *IBrokers* functions and variables are preserved exactly in *IBrokers2*, while some additional functions have been added.  The new functions mostly provide additional trade execution capabilities, for running systematic trading strategies in a callback loop.


### Installation and loading

Install package *IBrokers2* from github:  
```{r eval=FALSE}
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github(repo="algoquant/IBrokers2")
library(IBrokers2)
```
<br>


### Implementation details


The original function *IBrokers::reqRealTimeBars()* is used for running trading strategies in a callback loop, by providing to it a customized *event wrapper* function, for example *IBrokers2::trade_wrapper()*.  The function *IBrokers2::trade_wrapper()* is derived from the function *IBrokers::eWrapper.RealTimeBars.CSV()*.  It creates a wrapper environment, defines the member function *realtimeBars()*, and returns the wrapper environment.  The function *realtimeBars()* is where the trading code resides, for updating a model and then executing trades based on it.

The function *IBrokers::reqRealTimeBars()* calls the functions *IBrokers::twsCALLBACK()* and *IBrokers2::trade_wrapper()*.  It then passes *trade_wrapper()* into *IBrokers::twsCALLBACK()*.  This way the wrapper environment created by *IBrokers2::trade_wrapper()* persists in the evaluation environment of the function *twsCALLBACK()*, in between bar data arrivals as a *mutable state*. 

The callback loop is performed inside the function *IBrokers::twsCALLBACK()*, which calls *IBrokers::processMsg()* in a loop, which in turn calls *realtimeBars()* (defined inside *IBrokers2::trade_wrapper()*). 

An example of a simple trading strategy can be run with the code in the file *IB_scripts.R* in the *scripts* sub-directory.  The user can customize this strategy by modifying the trading code in *realtimeBars()*.
